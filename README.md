### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2022

+ Projec title: Feminism
+ This project is conducted by [Saumya Pandey]

+ Project summary: [a short summary] In 2022, the topic, feminism, creates divides. There is one side of people (including females) that don't think of themselves as feminists. Their reasons include that it is a man-hating group that exists solely for the benefit of women. They believe that the feminist-group believes in them being superior than males and that they deserve more. While, there are some feminists who certainly believe in that and preach that, for the remainder of the people believing in feminism, it is further from the truth. For them, feminism is a movement to support them in getting the same opportunities as men - whether it be in terms of career, salary, etc. So, as just described, there is a lot of controversies and mixed opinions surrounding feminism at the present. This is what feminism is like in 2022. But what was it like in the earlier years and centuries? What were people striving for back then? What were the issues and concerns raised at that time? These are the questions that will be answered through the data set compiled for the Philosophy Data Project.

This folder is organized as follows.

Doc contains - the main notebook and the corresponding PDF file (the report). Please read the comments in the code which is in the RMD file. If there are any errors that occur, it is most probably written in the comments as to what to do. There might be some installation of packages needed. You will have to be set the working directory or put the path directory to where the data set is on line 26. The subsets of the data can be created within the RMD file. Hence, I didn't put any processed data in the output folder.
