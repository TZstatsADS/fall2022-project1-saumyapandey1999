### [Project Description](doc/)

Term: Fall 2022

+ Project title: Feminism
+ This project is conducted by [Saumya Pandey]

+ Project summary: In 2022, the topic, feminism, creates divides. There is one side of people (including females) that don't think of themselves as feminists. Their reasons include that it is a man-hating group that exists solely for the benefit of women. They believe that the feminist-group believes in them being superior than males and that they deserve more. For the remainder, feminism is a movement to support women in getting the same opportunities as men - whether it be in terms of career, salary, etc. So, as just described, there is a lot of controversies and mixed opinions surrounding feminism at the present. This is what feminism is like in 2022. But what was it like in the earlier years and centuries? What were people striving for back then? What were the issues and concerns raised at that time? These are the questions that were answered through the data set. In this project, I used sentiment analysis, word frequency and word cloud visualizations, topic modeling and also findAssocs() function for the purpose of figuring out word associations. The results were that back then, the role of females was generally to take care of their family and their marriage. The issues or concerns were slavery, oppression, rape, being seen and treated as objects, class inequality, etc. The feminism movement then was about access to basic human rights, access to education, was regarding sufferage, etc. Even though, with time, the topics of the feminism movement have changed, the core of it remains the same - to give them the same opportunities as everyone else and to treat them like everyone else. 

This folder is organized as follows.

Doc contains - the main notebook and the corresponding PDF file (the report). Please read the comments in the code which is in the RMD file. There might be some installation of packages needed. You will have to set the working directory or put the path directory to where the data set is on line 26. The subsets of the data can be created within the RMD file. Hence, I didn't put any processed data in the output folder.
